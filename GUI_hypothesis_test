# 3.6. Can we claim at 0.05 significance level that the proportion

# Education plays a crucial role in shaping individuals' lives and 
# opportunities. In particular, the accessibility and

# [Introduction part]
# Our hypothesis:
# The null hypothesis: proportion of sample with Male secondary
# education greater than 95 is equal to the proportion of 
# sample with F_secondary_educ greater then 95.

# The alternative hypothesis: the proportion of sample with male secondary
# education greater than 95 is greater than the proportion of sample 
# with female secondary education greater than 95.

# Assumptions of  z-test for 2 population proportions:
# 1. The samples are randomly selected. The data is collected randomly,
# therefore we can assume that random sampling.
# The samples are independent.
